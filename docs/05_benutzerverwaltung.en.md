# User Management

The system distinguishes two clearly defined user roles to manage access rights securely and clearly.

## Standard (Team Member)
This role is intended for regular on-site use.

- Access **only** to the search page (`index.html`)
- Can freely search and filter
- May activate/deactivate dark mode
- Can register and use biometrics (Passkeys) for the own device

Team members have no access to administrative functions.

## Admin (Technical Administrator)
This role has full access to the admin panel (`admin.html`).

- Create and delete objects (locations/sites)
- Manage the user database (create, edit, delete accounts)
- Perform data uploads (link CSV files)

This allows administrators to maintain the data base and add new users.
