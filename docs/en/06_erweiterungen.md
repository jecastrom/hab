# Planned Extensions

The application is designed for stepwise extension. Here are the most important planned features for the near future:

## Hekatron Integration
Extension of the existing CSV parser to also support export files from Hekatron projects.

- The parser will be supplemented with new field mappings and cleaning rules
- Goal: Seamless processing and search of Hekatron data alongside current ESSER data

This makes the app usable for a wider range of fire alarm systems.

## Microsoft SSO
Integration with **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD) for enterprise-wide Single Sign-On.

- Users can log in directly with their Microsoft work accounts
- No separate user management needed
- Higher security and easier administration in enterprise environments

## Extended Activity Logs
Introduction of server-side logging of important actions.

- Logging of search queries (anonymized)
- Recording of administrator actions (e.g., uploads, deletions, user changes)
- Purpose: Auditability and traceability for audits

This increases compliance and transparency of the application.
